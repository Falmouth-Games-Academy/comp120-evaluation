\section{Introduction}
I have identified three key skills that I have struggled to use and develop throughout the course. I have struggled to read and understand peers' code, as well as finding it difficult to manage my time and priorities. (And another one that I haven't thought of yet)

\section{Reading and Understanding Peers' Code}
When reviewing peers' code, I have often had difficulty reading, understanding, and picking out the relevant parts.

This is an important skill to develop as it has a number of applications both in education and industry. Reading code is essential in collaborative projects, as it is necessary both to understand the code-base you are contributing to and review the contributions of your peers.

My weakness in this area is most likely due to lack of experience reading and writing code. In order to develop this skill, I will ensure that I read, review and comment on peers' code on GitHub each week. I will assess my progress in this skill at the end of the second term. I will know that I have improved by evaluating how long I spend reading a peers' code before I can think of appropriate and useful comments to make on it. 

\section{Time Management and Project Planning}
Another weakness that has affected me throughout the course is the lack of ability to manage my time effectively.

This is an essential skill to develop to ensure success in both academic and professional contexts. Time management and project planning is necessary for ensuring that deadlines for large projects are met, as well as ensuring that other relevant areas are not neglected. This is also an essential skill for effective team work, as it allows team members to make progress consistently if they know what the other members are working on and when. Improving my time management and project planning skills will allow me to be a reliable member of a team.

My perfectionistic nature has likely contributed to my struggle with prioritising tasks and projects, as I do not stop working on a task even though it has been completed. Another cause for this difficulty may be due to having had a long time out of education or work. I will tackle this issue by creating a study plan at the beginning of each week, to organise my time based on assignment priorities. At the end of the second term, I will assess the success of this strategy by measuring how often I managed to stick to the study plan and whether it allowed me to finish assignments before the deadline.
